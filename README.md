## Install dependencies

The project dependencies are managed with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).
You need to run `carthage update --platform ios` to fetch the dependencies and build their libraries/frameworks.

## TODO
- NCX and Navigation Document parsing.
- Exhaustive metadata parsing.
- Add support Media Overlay.
- Fonts deobfuscation.
- Add support for content filters in the fetcher.
