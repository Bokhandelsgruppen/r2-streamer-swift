## Install dependencies

The project dependencies are managed with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).
You need to run `carthage update --platform ios` to fetch the dependencies and build their frameworks.

## TODO

- Add support for content filters in the fetcher
- Add content filters for deobfuscation and decryption
